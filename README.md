Implement a paper by Ovsjanikov et al. 2010, "One Point Isometric Matching with the Heat Kernel". Finding an intrinsic isometry between two meshes normally takes a quadratic time. However, by using Heat Kernel under certain conditions, we can find the isometry by using only a single correspondence.

See the writeup for further information.
